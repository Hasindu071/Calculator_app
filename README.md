## **How It Works**

1. **User Interface**: The calculator's layout is created using Flutter widgets such as `Container`, `Row`, and `Column`.
2. **State Management**: State is managed locally using `StatefulWidget`.
3. **Operations**: Arithmetic operations are performed using simple mathematical logic in Dart.
